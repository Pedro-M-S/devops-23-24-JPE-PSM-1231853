## Technical Report

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source platform designed for automating the deployment, scaling,
and management of containerized applications. It provides a robust framework to run distributed systems resiliently
and allows developers to focus on building applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
Here, we will delve into the theoretical aspects of Kubernetes, covering its architecture, key components,
and fundamental concepts.

### Key Concepts and Components of Kubernetes

### 1. **Architecture**

Kubernetes architecture follows a client-server model comprising several components that work together to maintain the
desired state of applications. The primary components are:

- **Master Node**: The control plane of Kubernetes, responsible for managing the cluster.
- **Worker Nodes**: Nodes where the application workloads run. Each worker node contains the necessary components to run
  pods.

### 2. **Master Components**

The master node hosts critical components that manage the cluster:

- **API Server**: The front end of the Kubernetes control plane, serving the Kubernetes API. It handles requests
  from users, tools, and components.
- **Etcd**: A consistent and highly-available key-value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.
- **Controller Manager**: Runs various controllers that regulate the state of the cluster, such as node controller,
  replication controller, and endpoint controller.
- **Scheduler**: Responsible for assigning pods to nodes based on resource availability and other constraints.

### 3. **Node Components**

Worker nodes host components necessary to run application containers:

- **Kubelet**: An agent that ensures containers are running in a pod. It interacts with the container
  runtime to start, stop, and manage containers.
- **Kube-proxy**: A network proxy that maintains network rules and allows network communication to the pods
  from inside or outside the cluster.
- **Container Runtime**: The software responsible for running containers. Kubernetes supports several runtimes,
  such as Docker, containerd, and CRI-O.

### 4. **Pods**

The smallest and simplest Kubernetes object, a pod, represents a single instance of a running process in a cluster.
Pods contain one or more containers, storage resources, and a unique network IP.

### 5. **ReplicaSets and Deployments**

- **ReplicaSet**: Ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.
- **Deployment**: Manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates to applications, enabling features like
  rolling updates and rollbacks.

### 6. **Services**

Services provide a stable IP address and DNS name for a set of pods, abstracting pod IP addresses that are
subject to change. They enable communication between different parts of an application.

### 7. **ConfigMaps and Secrets**

- **ConfigMaps**: Used to store non-confidential configuration data in key-value pairs.
- **Secrets**: Used to store sensitive data, such as passwords and API keys, securely.

### 8. **Volumes**

Kubernetes Volumes provide a way for pods to access persistent storage. Unlike Docker volumes, Kubernetes volumes can be
used to share data between containers in a pod and persist data beyond the life of a pod.

### 9. **Namespaces**

Namespaces provide a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single Kubernetes cluster. They are useful
for dividing cluster resources between multiple users or teams.

### 10. **Ingress**

Ingress is an API object that manages external access to services within a cluster, typically HTTP. Ingress
controllers handle the traffic routing based on defined rules.

### Advantages of Kubernetes

- **Scalability**: Automatically scale applications up and down based on demand.
- **Portability**: Run workloads consistently across different environments, from development to production.
- **Resilience**: Automatically replaces and reschedules failed containers and nodes.
- **Automation**: Automates deployment, updates, and scaling processes, reducing manual intervention.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimizes the utilization of resources across a cluster, improving cost-efficiency.

### How to Use Kubernetes for CA4(Part 2)

To achieve the same setup for CA4(Part 2), you would follow these steps:

1. **Define Kubernetes Manifests**:
    - Create YAML files to define the Kubernetes objects needed for your application, including Deployments, Services,
      PersistentVolumes, and PersistentVolumeClaims.

2. **Deployments**:
    - Create a Deployment for the H2 Database Server, specifying the container image, ports, and volume mounts.
    - Create a Deployment for the Tomcat Web Server, specifying the container image, ports, and volume mounts.
    - Ensure each Deployment specifies the number of replicas and resource requests/limits for scaling and resource
      management.

3. **Services**:
    - Define Services to expose each Deployment. The Service for the H2 Database should expose the necessary ports for
      database access.
    - The Service for the Tomcat Web Server should expose the web application port.
    - Use ClusterIP for internal communication or NodePort/LoadBalancer for external access.

4. **Persistent Storage**:
    - Define PersistentVolumes (PVs) to provision storage resources for your containers.
    - Create PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) to request storage for your pods. Ensure the PVCs match the storage
      class and size requirements of your PVs.

5. **Networking**:
    - Configure networking to ensure pods can communicate with each other. Kubernetes handles this with internal DNS and
      networking.
    - Use Ingress resources if you need to manage external access to your services via HTTP/HTTPS, with rules for
      routing traffic.

6. **Configuration and Secrets**:
    - Use ConfigMaps to store and manage non-sensitive configuration data.
    - Use Secrets to manage sensitive data such as passwords and API keys securely.

7. **Deployment Management**:
    - Apply the Kubernetes manifests using `kubectl apply -f <manifest_file>`.
    - Monitor the state of your deployments with `kubectl get deployments`, `kubectl get pods`,
      and `kubectl get services`.

8. **Scaling and Updates**:
    - Leverage Kubernetesâ€™ rolling updates to deploy new versions of your application without downtime.
    - Use autoscaling features to automatically adjust the number of pod replicas based on resource usage or custom
      metrics.

By structuring your application with these Kubernetes components, you can achieve a scalable, resilient, and manageable
deployment similar to the one described in CA4(Part 2).

### Conclusion

Kubernetes provides a comprehensive framework for managing containerized applications. Its architecture, centered around
the master node and worker nodes, ensures scalability, resilience, and efficient resource management. By abstracting the
complexity of the underlying infrastructure, Kubernetes allows developers to focus on delivering value through their
applications. Understanding these theoretical aspects is crucial for leveraging Kubernetes to its full potential in a
production environment.
